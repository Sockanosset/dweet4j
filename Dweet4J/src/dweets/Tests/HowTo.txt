dweet4j will allow you to easily connect and communicate to the dweet webservice at: http://dweet.io/

This library depends on some well known third part libraries:

commons-logging-1.2.jar
httpasyncclient-4.0.1.jar
httpclient-4.3.4.jar
httpcore-4.3.2.jar
httpcore-nio-4.3.2.jar
httpmime-4.3.4.jar
json-20140107.jar

Make sure these are in your project build path.

Review the DweetTest.java file to quickly test the dweet.io process.
