This is an unofficial Java library to communicate to the dweet.io server. The dweet.io is a fantastic free webservice (for public 'things') found at http://dweet.io that offers the developer an ease of use service. I do not work for and I am not affiliated to Bug Labs, Inc., the company that brought you dweet.io.

I wanted to use this service and found nothing on the web for a nice Java implementation, so I decided to build my own. The library depends on the Apache HTTPClient libraries and JSON library to communicate to the dweet.io service.

Currently, this library is very basic (alpha) but almost all commands to the web service have their basic implementations. I will continually update and add to the library as needed.

Please offer up any changes or advice to make this a better library. I will keep this library in alpha until all of the commands are working.
